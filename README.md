## What is Stack8?

Stack8 is a project focused on Platform Engineering, aiming to "Provide an engineering environment with a single command". It sets out to offer the following three components:

1. A scalable application runtime environment that fulfills enterprise-level security requirements.
2. DevOps environments that facilitate a rewarding development and operation experience.
3. Comprehensive documentation detailing the architecture and employed libraries, coupled with update procedures.

Here's an outline of the challenges this project aims to address:

- In companies with rigorous internal security requirements, development teams lacking resources often struggle to swiftly set up an engineering environment that meets required standards.
- Improvised engineering setups with limited resources can result in a subpar development experience and overlook potentially critical vulnerabilities.
- Engineering environments turn into debts when there is a scarcity of team members who grasp the project complexities and are unable to perform suitable updates.

Conversely, the following are beyond the project's scope:

- Reducing infrastructure costs: the project targets the engineering in the enterprise, not aiming to save on infrastructure costs for individual projects.
- Versatility to increase the number of users: focus on YAGNI and KISS principles and support only the minimum number of functions.

## Roadmap

Stack8 will be developed as we use it in the development of specific applications. Therefore, we expect it will take at least two years for all features to reach GA. Although Stack8 will be released as open source, for the time being, priority will be given to use within the companies to which the committers belong, and documentation will be developed at a later date.
